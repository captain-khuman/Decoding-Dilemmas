# Decoding-Dilemmas
Applying reinforcement learning to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game, our project develops AI agents to learn optimal strategies through repeated interactions. We explore various player strategies and evaluate their performance, offering insights into strategic decision-making dynamics and AI-driven cooperative behavior.
