# Decoding Dilemmas

Welcome to Decoding Dilemmas! This project is all about understanding a cool game called the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD). It's like a game where two friends have to decide whether to work together or be selfish.

## Understanding the Game
In the IPD game, players play many rounds. They can either choose to work together (cooperate) or be selfish (defect). Depending on what both players choose, they get different points:
- If both cooperate, they both get some points.
- If one cooperates and the other defects, the defector gets more points, and the cooperator gets fewer.
- If both defect, they both get the fewest points.

## Our Approach: RL Q-Learning
To help understand how to play this game better, we're using a smart computer method called Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a technique called Q-learning. The computer learns the best strategies by trying different things and seeing what works best over time.

## How to Get Started
To see how the game works and watch the smart computer players:
1. Download this project to your computer.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Open the folder with the 'gametheorymain.py' file in it.
4. Run the file by typing 'python gametheorymain.py' in your terminal.
5. Follow the instructions on the screen to play the game and see how the computer players do.
