# Decoding Dilemmas

Welcome to Decoding Dilemmas! This project explores the fascinating world of game theory through the lens of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game. In this classic game, two players must decide whether to cooperate or defect, each aiming to maximize their own payoff while facing the risk of mutual defection.

## Game Rules
The IPD game unfolds over multiple rounds, with each player choosing to cooperate or defect in each round. The payoffs depend on both players' choices:
- If both players cooperate, they each receive a moderate payoff.
- If one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector receives a higher payoff while the cooperator receives a lower payoff.
- If both players defect, they both receive the lowest payoff.

## RL Q-Learning Approach
To tackle the strategic complexities of the IPD game, we employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, specifically Q-learning. Through RL, our AI agents learn to make optimal decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards over multiple iterations of the game. The Q-learning algorithm enables the agents to adapt and refine their strategies based on past experiences and environmental feedback.

## Instructions
To run the code and explore the IPD game dynamics:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `gametheorymain.py` file.
4. Run the script using the command `python gametheorymain.py`.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the IPD simulation and observe the AI agents' behavior.

Feel free to experiment with different parameter settings, AI strategies, and environmental conditions to gain deeper insights into the strategic interactions within the IPD game.

Happy decoding dilemmas!
